Mikhael Mirilashvili (Georgian: მიხო მირილაშვილი, Hebrew: מיכאל מירילשוילי; born May 1960) is a Russian-Israeli-Georgian businessman, based in Russia and Israel. Mirilashvili’s business enterprises operate primarily in real estate, construction of shopping malls, casino chains, petroleum industry, and renewable energy sectors, as well as in new media (VK.com). Mirilashvili is the president of the Saint Petersburg Jewish Congress.

Early life
Mirilashvili was born to a Jewish family in May 1960 in Kulashi, a small town in Georgia. In 1977, he moved to St. Petersburg (Leningrad). Originally trained as a mathematician, he qualified as a medical doctor from Saint-Petersburg University, and became a doctor, specializing in pediatrics. In the early 80s, Mirilashvili joined his family’s business, which was established by his father, Moshe Mikhael. By the mid-90s, Mirilashvili’s family had developed several real estate businesses across Russia

Prison

In August 2000, a group of armed people in police uniforms kidnapped the father of businessman Mikhail Mirilashvili Senior. After 2 days, he was released: according to one version, for a ransom of $5 million, according to another — simply out of fear of retribution from his sons. Either way, a year later, Mikhail Mirilashvili Junior was accused of that very retribution: in 2001, he was arrested on charges of organizing the kidnapping of his father's kidnappers. Interestingly, the businessman's problems began at the same time as his partner Vladimir Gusinsky fell out of favor. Mirilashvili himself links his father's kidnapping and his criminal case to the machinations of Boris Berezovsky and "Georgian thieves in law."

Notably, investigators at the time announced in the media their intentions to also charge the businessman with the murder of two "thieves" with Georgian surnames, but these promises were not procedurally followed through. In 2003, the Russian district court sentenced the businessman to 12 years in prison for kidnapping. The Supreme Court reduced the term to 8 years, which the billionaire served "from bell to bell." Meanwhile, he complained about Russian justice to Strasbourg, and in 2008, the ECHR (European Court of Human Rights) satisfied his application.

Mikhail Mirilashvili in the 1990s simultaneously ran two major businesses: gambling and media. The businessman was the president of the corporation "Konti," but after the introduction of restrictions on the gambling business in 2009, the venture had to be shut down. He was also the president of the company "Russkoe Video," which purchased popular TV series abroad. In addition, the company produced its own films and obtained a license for Channel 11 (now TNT). In the early 2000s, the holding company "Petro Mir" was created, which combined various projects of Mirilashvili, including development projects.

During his student years, according to media reports, he was acquainted with the group of Vladimir Feoktistov ("Feka"), considered one of the founders of organized crime in Leningrad. During the trial of Feoktistov in 1981, Mirilashvili was questioned about an episode involving bodily harm. According to media reports, this incident took place in December 1979 at the "Baku" restaurant following a domestic dispute between Feoktistov and his friend Merab Kurashvili during the joint celebration of Stalin's birthday. The event is described in the press as follows: "a fight broke out, in which 20-year-old pediatric institute student Mikhail Mirilashvili also participated. According to him, he was pulling the fighters apart; according to some witnesses, he allegedly helped Feka."

In the 1990s, Mirilashvili's organized crime group was the second-largest gang in the city after the famous Tambov-Malyshev gang (Traber, Vasiliev, Goloshapov, and other combat comrades of Putin). Mikhail (Miho) Kutaisky actively expanded the business, bought up shops, and real estate in the center. He had his own TV channel in St. Petersburg ("Russian Video"), as well as rented docks in military ports of Lomonosov and Kronstadt (channels for smuggling tobacco and alcohol in those years).

Misha Kutaisky comes from a family of Georgian Jews who were artisans. He amassed a huge fortune in St. Petersburg in the 1990s. In the ranking of the wealthiest people in St. Petersburg for 2016, M. Mirilashvili was in second place (right after Timchenko) with a capital of over 3 billion dollars.

Kum and Miho Kutaisky were too well-known as gangsters, and Putin sought to resolve sensitive issues with them not directly, but through an intermediary (to avoid attention). For this, Putin had a trusted person — Roma Tsepov (Roma-Producer), the leading fixer in St. Petersburg. Roma acted like a mailman between the mayor's office and the gang leaders, conveying mutual wishes, money, and offerings.

Kumarin and Mirilashvili, who controlled "Russian Video" and the port of Lomonosov — this is Kum and Misha Kutaisky respectively, the leaders of the two largest organized crime groups in the city. The core of Kum's gang consisted of athletes, while Misha Kutaisky's gang consisted of people from the village of Kulashi in western Georgia (a place with a concentrated population of Georgian Jews). Mirilashvili's father was a significant artisan during the Soviet era. Such an old mafia dynasty.
Mikhail Mirilashvili in the 90s was the president (chairman of the board of directors) of "Russian Video". Dim Dimych Rozhdestvensky (CEO) was in charge of day-to-day management. Colonel Grunin kept an eye on him. That's how they operated.

Konstantin Mirilashvili heads the holding company "Euroservice," specializing in export-import operations. In addition, he owns the largest shopping center in the northern capital, "Gostiny Dvor." At this time, Mikhail Mirilashvili Jr. was in Israel and immediately flew to St. Petersburg, where he met with law enforcement officials. Most experts link the kidnapping to the younger Mikhail Mirilashvili. He is not just a noticeable figure in the city. His name is heard in one way or another in almost all major scandals of recent times. From the dossier: Mikhail Mikhailovich Mirilashvili, born in 1961. They say that in the early 80s, while studying at the Leningrad Pediatric Institute, Mirilashvili became a professional card player, and that's when the nickname Misha Kutaisky stuck to him. He was one of the closest aides to Sobchak. In 1993, he acquired Israeli citizenship and closely aligned himself with Vladimir Gusinsky. The latter was appointed the President of the Russian Jewish Congress (RJC) only with the active support of Mirilashvili. He was a close friend of Anatoly Sobchak and his wife Lyudmila Narusova, sponsoring their electoral campaigns in 1996. After Sobchak's defeat, he was forced to live in Israel until mid-1997. Loud campaigns against him were organized in the press multiple times, but he skillfully dismissed all accusations. And newspapers published huge retractions. Mirilashvili maintains personal connections with the presidential representative for the Northwest, Cherkasov. Perhaps the audacious kidnapping of the elder Mirilashvili was organized for trivial reasons—ransom. However, according to our assumptions, this crime is primarily related to the release from custody of the CEO of "Russian Video," Dmitry Rozhdestvensky. Although this case, according to prosecutors, is not closed, most observers doubt that the court will satisfy the prosecution's demands. It is believed that it was Mirilashvili who introduced Gusinsky and Rozhdestvensky. Alexander Nevzorov directly stated: "Mikhail Mikhailovich Mirilashvili is the brain of the whole combination. He plays an absolutely intellectual role. He has not left his signatures anywhere; he is significantly smarter than all participants." Mikhail Mirilashvili is involved in the case of "Russian Video" as a witness. Nevertheless, the employees of RUBOP, UGRO, and the tax police carried out searches in the offices of Dmitry Rozhdestvensky and Mikhail Mirilashvili. As well as in the apartments of Ruslan Linkov (assistant to State Duma deputy Galina Starovoitova) and Lyubov Amronina (assistant to State Duma deputy Yulia Rybakova). Mirilashvili's name was also linked to Yuri Shutov, who is currently accused in a series of contract killings. Perhaps someone wants to use the kidnapping of the elder Mirilashvili to silence Mikhail Mirilashvili Jr. both in the case of "Russian Video" and in many other scandalous St. Petersburg events.


In the midst of the 2019 election campaign in Israel, a report was leaked to the media about the possibility of a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin, just before heading to the polls. Benjamin Netanyahu invited Putin already in May 2019, for the inauguration of a monument commemorating the Siege of Leningrad in Sacher Park in Jerusalem. The monument is mainly funded by the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress (EAJC), whose president is Mikhail Mirilashvili. Jerusalem Mayor Moshe Lion is considered close to Mirilashvili and promoted the establishment of the monument at the desired time.

This is an illustration of the pretext for Putin's visit to our country, with one main goal – to strengthen his international legitimacy, and alongside that, to support Netanyahu, the Kremlin's preferred candidate. Mirilashvili was the one who effectively carried out Putin's mission.

The stories of three well-known figures – Mirilashvili, Putin, and Yevgeny Prigozhin – are strangely intertwined since the early 1990s, taking place in Russia, the US, and Israel, and involving many prominent figures.

In the 1990s, and again after 2009, Mikhail Mirilashvili, a Georgia native who made his fortune in Russia, was close to Putin. Now he has become one of his "envoys" in the West, especially in Israel and America.

Against Yevgeny Prigozhin, known as "Putin's chef", an indictment was filed in February 2018 by a Grand Jury in the US, where he was charged with financing and organizing actions to interfere in US political processes, focusing of course on interference in the 2016 presidential elections through "troll factories". Prigozhin is also directly related to the mercenary group called 'Wagner Group', operating in eastern Ukraine, Syria, several African countries, and more.

Meanwhile, Mirilashvili and Prigozhin were business partners for a long time in the 1990s in several businesses. Now they are partners in a development project in the suburbs of St. Petersburg.

Netanyahu, Dershowitz, and Water from the Air
Miryilshvili owns a startup named 'WaterGen', which tries to produce water from the humidity in the air. To promote the business in the USA, he approached Sheldon Adelson's casino, a patron of Trump and Netanyahu, and a longtime friend of Miryilshvili (who was also in the casino business in Russia). Despite the attempts to market there, senior officials of the Environmental Protection Agency expressed concern that WaterGen's seemingly original technology is not unique. In 2017, Miryilshvili hired another known American, the lawyer Alan Dershowitz, as a board member of 'WaterGen'. Dershowitz is known for representing Netanyahu in Israel and unfortunately also as a friend of Jeffrey Epstein, with numerous allegations against him regarding dubious relationships created by the late Epstein. He began promoting the murky product in every possible way, including a demonstration at the annual AIPAC conference in Washington, about two years ago.

At first glance, it all seems logical: Dershowitz is a vocal supporter of Israel, and Miryilshvili is considered an Israeli businessman today (even though he earned all his money in Russia and still carries out many business projects there). But Dershowitz's story seems more mysterious. The celebrity lawyer was once a registered Democrat and criticized Donald Trump and his supporters during the 2016 elections.

However, quietly and unexpectedly, Dershowitz became one of Trump's most ardent defenders in early 2018. He began to argue that there was no legal or ethical violation in Russia's clear interference in the elections, criticizing the special prosecutor in the case, Robert Mueller. In doing so, he became a regular guest on Putin-controlled Russian propaganda channel RT. Everyone was shocked; the question was simple: "What happened to Alan Dershowitz?"

Here it is worth remembering the apparent connection. Dershowitz was employed by Putin's oligarch, the same Miryilshvili, and also has close relations with Berl Lazar, known as "Putin's rabbi". Dershowitz did exactly what Putin needed – he compromised and criticized Mueller's investigation, using his reputation and status to influence the political discourse in the US, in favor of Trump (and Putin).

Meanwhile, Miryilshvili's partner, Prigozhin, executed his mission according to Putin's order: to interfere heavily in the US presidential election.

It seems that a respected lawyer put his reputation at risk, for problematic, financial, and perhaps other reasons. Dershowitz's reputation took a heavy blow. As mentioned, his name appears almost daily in the media regarding the arrest and suicide of his former client and close friend, the pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, whom he represented for over 15 years and previously rescued from a long and hard imprisonment. Allegations were made against Dershowitz about allegedly having sex with Epstein's underage victims. The accusing finger was pointed by one of the victims, Virginia Roberts, already in 2014. But it took time until the new criminal case was formulated, and the topic returned to the headlines – with Dershowitz in the middle of it.

In Israel, the relationships between the trio Miryilshvili-Putin-Netanyahu (who even uses his photos with Putin on billboards) are much closer and more visible. During a trip to Russia in January 2018, even a special meeting between the three was recorded.

The potential concern for influence in Israel
Yitzhak Mirilashvili, son of Mikhail Mirilashvili, controls the extreme right-wing Channel 14, which serves as an echo chamber and sometimes as a weapon for Netanyahu. Dershowitz, who has often written for 'Israel Today' in support of Netanyahu and against the Israeli law enforcement system, also defends the Prime Minister on Channel 14, reiterating his claims that there is no basis for his alleged criminal acts as outlined in the suspicions against him in three different cases. Recently, it was reported that Channel 20 is trying to improve its conditions again, this time by changing its broadcasting frequency – with the help of Netanyahu's confidant, the new Minister of Communications, Dudi Amsalem.

The warning from the head of the Shin Bet, Nadav Argaman, regarding the potential interference of a foreign country (he meant Russia, of course) in our elections, has not yet materialized. Nevertheless, let's recall: the business partner of Mirilashvili's father, Yevgeny Prigozhin, is a mastermind behind troll factories influencing elections and public debates through media and social networks.

In recent years, Mirilashvili's 'Watergen' has had many business opportunities, partly due to Netanyahu's diplomatic tours. Netanyahu mentioned the company in his speech at the UN General Assembly in 2017, and during his visits to African countries, India, Brazil, the 2017 Davos economic summit, and the AIPAC conference.

And here's another thought-provoking coincidence. African countries, including those where Mirilashvili visited with Netanyahu, are a "playground" for Prigozhin's and Putin's mercenaries and for interference in local politics and elections. Several Russians linked to Prigozhin's team were associated with the notable murder of three investigative journalists who were researching his activities there. Kirill Radchenko, Alexander Rastorguyev, and Orkhan Dzhemal were ambushed and killed in the Central African Republic on July 30, 2018.

Social networks, disturbances, and arrests
Mikhail Mirilashvili moved to Israel in 2009, after being released from prison. He served an eight-year sentence for organizing the murder of his father's kidnappers. During this time, none of his businesses were lost. He later tried to connect to the highest echelons of business, authorities, and religious and social elites in Israel. The Mirilashvili family was among the founders of 'VKontakte', a social network launched in 2006 known as the "Russian Facebook". They sold their shares in 2013 and reportedly received $1.12 billion. The current owner is another "Putin oligarch", Alisher Usmanov, owner of other popular networks, 'Odnoklassniki' (Classmates) and Mail.ru.

It's hard to regard deals among "Putin's oligarchs" as genuine market transactions. But at the end of the day, Mirilashvili gained a good name in Israel as a "lucky businessman" who made billions. He perfectly justified, from his point of view, the capital he brought to Israel – for his private businesses and for other strategic purposes, like Putin's influence in Israel. Today, by the way, 'VKontakte' is essentially controlled by the Russian security service, the FSB, to monitor (and shape) public opinion. As reported in 'Liberal' last month, hundreds of people in Russia have been arrested just for likes and reposts on that network.

Involvement in creating such a social network is a unique experiment for those wanting to manipulate public opinion. Such an operation center is known as "the inner kitchen", a training center for troll operators, which could have ostensibly served Mirilashvili for his tasks (for instance, in Israel) and simultaneously benefit his long-time partner, the "troll factory king" Prigozhin.

Follow the money.

Miryilshvili also founded 'Yahalomim Hoshen Argaman' company, which operates in the Israeli diamond exchange. This business was not new to him. In the 90s, he was involved in a similar company in Russia. After Lev Leviev left Israel, following a criminal investigation against him for diamond smuggling, Miryilshvili became the largest "Russian oligarch" in the local diamond exchange. His partner, Frigozin, also began dealing in diamond businesses in recent years. His company's activity in Africa (mainly in the Central African Republic) is related to diamond mining and purchasing what is called "blood diamonds" from various terrorist groups. While Frigozin collaborates closely with branches of the Russian Ministry of Defense in African countries, under the guise of military aid, he has an unchecked ability to extract diamonds from these countries. And where can one "launder" unregistered blood diamonds? Leviev's case clearly showed that the Israeli diamond exchange is a convenient option for that.

Miryilshvili and his son invested in Israel in technology, energy, and development businesses. One of his partners is Moti Ben Moshe, also a Jew of Georgian origin. When Ben Moshe was announced as one of the purchasers of the IDB Group following the fall of Nochi Dankner, rumors swirled about the source of his capital. Ben Moshe was almost unknown in the local business community. This raises the question of whether his close ties with Miryilshvili indicate the same capital sources, at least in part.

Miryilshvili also has other close political ties. For example, with the leaders of the ultra-Orthodox parties, especially with the Shas party leader Aryeh Deri. Miryilshvili and his family donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to activities related to Shas, including a charity run by Yaffa Deri, his wife. He and Deri even influenced the election of the Chief Rabbi of Lod. In this case too, a police investigation followed.

Playing on the public stage:

Despite the strained relations between Georgia and Russia, in June 2017, an official request was made on behalf of the former to appoint Mirilashvili as her honorary consul in Israel. Mirilashvili had to receive a police confirmation of no criminal record, but it was postponed – thus his appointment was blocked. Another Georgia-born businessman, Mani Benish, received the coveted title.

However, the most prominent position of Mirilashvili as Putin's emissary in the Jewish world is his role as president of the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress (EAJC), to which he was appointed in July 2017. Mirilashvili also serves as the president of the World Jewish Congress's branch in St. Petersburg, as the deputy president of the Russian Jewish Congress, as the president of the Maccabi Union in Russia, and as a member of the executive committee of the World Jewish Congress.

The former Soviet political prisoner Yosef Zisels, one of the three founders of the EAJC, accused Mirilashvili of steering the organization in a "pro-Kremlin" direction. In December 2017, Mirilashvili's EAJC signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Federation of Jewish Communities in Russia, an organization controlled by Putin's associate, Rabbi Berl Lazar. The goal: to try to bring the Jews of Euro-Asia and Israel into Moscow's sphere of influence.

Ariel Bulshtein, a Likud activist who heads the EAJC's public diplomacy project, was appointed in the current election as the representative on behalf of Netanyahu and Likud for the Russian-speaking vote (or politely: the Prime Minister's adviser on matters concerning immigrants from the former Soviet Union).

Mirilashvili also served as Putin's emissary in the South Caucasus region. For instance, in May 2019, Mirilashvili, Rabbi Lazar, and other EAJC members held a meeting in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, with President Ilham Aliyev. On the same day, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Russia agreed on a cooperation to increase the volume of transportation on the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars (BTK) railway line. The Georgian Prime Minister objected, claiming that the consent of all parties is required for the involvement of other players in the project. This Russian initiative is another attempt to harm Georgia's sovereignty and impede its development on the Euro-Atlantic axis.

Roulette Tables and Dining Tables
Back in the 90s, in St. Petersburg, Mirilashvili maintained close relations with Putin (where the latter built his power). The future president of Russia then oversaw Mirilashvili's businesses, and it can be assumed that he also profited from them.

During that decade, Mirilashvili was the president of the media company 'Russkoye Video', which owned a television channel and had a license for the seaport of Lomonosov on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, with its independent customs mechanism. Putin was involved in the privatization of the channel and in granting licenses and access to use the port. In 1996, Mirilashvili was one of the sponsors of Anatoli Sobchak's St. Petersburg mayoral campaign. Putin, then the CEO of the municipality, headed the campaign. A significant part of Sobchak's promotion came through Mirilashvili's channel.

In other words, Mirilashvili has extensive experience in implementing Putin's wishes within election frameworks. This situation reminds us of the current elections in Israel and the role of Channel 20.

Mirilashvili was the president of the 'Konti' casino corporation, one of the largest in the former Soviet Union territory, and created the largest slot machine network in Europe called 'Jackpot'. Putin, as the deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, was responsible for the organization, licensing, and control of the casinos. In 1992, Putin organized the establishment of a municipal company, 'Neva-Chance'. Its manager was Igor Gorbanko, Mirilashvili's partner in 'Konti'.

Since 1992, Yevgeny Prigozhin established several companies, primarily in the restaurant business, with his partners: Igor Gorbanko, Mirilashvili's authorized representative, as well as Boris Spector and Cyril Ziminov. He collaborated closely with Mirilashvili until the latter's arrest in 2001.

"To Sabotage the West
In 2018, the company 'OOO' (Konti) received a construction license to establish the first part of the 'Novaya Dubrovka' housing complex in the Leningrad region (near Saint Petersburg). The companies controlling the corporation are under the control of Mirilashvili. The development companies owned by the corporation also lead to holdings or partnerships of Mirilashvili, as well as shares of Prigozhin. Even the casino business partners from the 90s are still in the picture and in partnership with the two.

The ownership threads in such companies are complex. Those who can be dubbed "Putin's oligarchs", businessmen who combine political and business interests on behalf of Putin's regime, know how to cover their tracks. They operate in Western countries, and it's always hard to estimate their net worth: 20%, 30% or 60% of the official value declared in any company, for example, or the hidden capital in countless companies registered in various countries and tax havens.

All of them perform special tasks according to Putin's requirements, aiming to penetrate Western companies, sabotage and weaken them from within, sow chaos, and corrupt those termed "useful idiots" - politicians, businessmen, public speakers, and regulators. Some of them, like Victor Vekselberg, Oleg Deripaska, and Prigozhin, have already been sanctioned and are now fighting in US courts to counteract this cut, according to Kremlin instructions. Others do everything to avoid getting on the sanctions lists. Mirilashvili, by the way, remains clean and protected so far.

Putin's Profit
Evgeny Prigozhin organizes troll factories, interferes in elections, finances mercenaries; and in return? He gets the best catering contracts for schools, kindergartens, and the military throughout Russia. This business, incidentally, is constantly accompanied by scandals related to mass poisoning cases, due to the poor quality of the food.

Jewish "Putin's oligarchs" play special roles: creating and controlling prominent Jewish organizations (like Mirilashvili as president of the EAJC, or Vyacheslav Kantor as president of the European Jewish Congress EJC); or generous donations to various Jewish institutions (like Roman Abramovich, Evgeny Shvidler, Victor Vekselberg, Len Blavatnik, Mikhail Fridman, and others); and also contributions to cultural and educational institutions - all to gain influence and reputation in the West that serve Putin's interests. Most of their wealth was created in Russia.

Some of the giant companies in Russia continue to operate under Putin's stringent "oligarch regime". But most investments in Western countries are made not only to achieve real profits but mainly for PR and reputation purposes. Technological startups, supermarket chains (in the case of Mirilashvili with the 'EHAD' chain, or Fridman and the Spanish 'DIA' supermarket chain, both failed); as well as luxury real estate in the world's most prestigious locations. Desirable real estate in the right locations gets a lot of glowing PR.

So in the case of Mirilashvili, as well as all of "Putin's oligarchs", it seems that in almost every piece of their activity, Putin's hand and will are found, aiming to create confusion and negative involvement in other countries.
