## Background

Lancelot: This is going to be a very meticulous job. Even worse than embroidering. We have to kill the dragon in each one of them.


Evgeny Schwartz. The Dragon. 

There is plenty of material written on how to topple dictatorships, generate revolutions, and so on. However, it is worth to note that post-revolution societies often live in violent and unstable social environment. The outcome of a regime change is often from a dictatorship to anarchy to another dictatorship at best and to a bloody war and genocide at worth (e.g., French revolution, Chinese revolution).  This book is dedicated to explain on how to transition from a dictatorship to a democracy without having millions killed, enslaved, and tortured. One can assume that book’s authors may hence advocate for a peaceful resistance (e.g., Ghandi’s methods or From Dictatorship to Democracy book). However, our book is not going to be oriented on one specific method of toppling regimes. In fact toppling regimes is not the main topic of this book at all. There is plenty of material dedicated to this topic. This book is dedicated to explain the process of transitioning to a democratic society after the so called the first step of transition from a dictatorship is over. 
We try to base this book less on our opinions and more on historical events that shaped successful long term transition to democracy.


## What is Democracy and how it starts <a name="what-is-democracy"></a>

These days if you ask what democracy is, people would start talking to you about elections, the principle of separation of powers, the freedom of speech/religion/assembly/work and so on. However, these topics do not describe the day-to-day life of a person in a democratic society. A person that lives in a democratic society is rarely concerned about these topics, not only because they are given to him, but also because people just don’t think this way in their daily lives. 
When we breath we don’t analyze how much oxygen gets into our lungs, we don’t count particles of contamination, and we don’t think about how many liters of blood are being pumped through our heart. We just breath. Same about democracy. People just live in it. Even though the above-listed democratic principles are important, they can’t be achieved without individuals in society understanding what democracy is and supporting it. Democracy is a true rule of people (comparing to the lies of Communism). If people do not want the society to be democratic, it just won’t be, no matter if the government tries to be democratic (e.g., treatment of black people in southern US states during the beginning and mid of 20th century). 
Democracy starts from individuals. People in democratic societies feel free, because they are mainly not restricted by their neighbours to do whatever they would like to so long they don’t bother their neighbours. To create a democratic society one should start from the population itself and its perception of what freedom is. There are plenty of examples when democracy is proclaimed into existence on a country/federal level, but in effect its democratic ideas do not exist and do not work on a local level, because local people may decide to not cherish democracy. For example, it is not rare in democratic countries to see slums controlled by mafia instead of police where people live under tyranny of drug dealers or terror groups. Even large geographic parts of democratic countries are controlled by tyranny. For example, drug lords in Columbia and Naxalite movement in India. 
!!! Add examples where even without mafia the locals don't support democracy !!!
In addition, for democratic law to work it is important that the society supports it. Police, army, courts, prison officers, are all part of the society; they too have families, kids, love partners, relatives; they too have feelings, ambitions, and so on. 
If someone hits a woman on a street because of a wrong dress code and the rest of the spectators on the street do not intervene to protect her and do not complain to the police or at least to the press afterwards, then it would be hard to maintain women rights of being dressed as they want in such society. No matter how protective the law is, the society and the individuals are responsible to protect it. Police work can not be done if there are no people that are willing to file a complaint against an assault and there are no witnesses to testify that an assault has happened.
Good example would be a case of the enrollment of James Meredith into the University of Mississippi. Even though by law James had the right to study in this university, he was black and the year was 1961. James received numerous death threats and local levels of government and university management went into long fight to not allow James to study. At the end the Federal government of US had to appoint Federal marshals to protect James’ life while he was studying at the university. Such heros as James promote democracy and when there are enough people in society that support such heroes, then the society is democratic. If not, the society cannot be democratic no matter what laws are written on paper. 


But let’s step aside for a minute. What exactly should these so called heroes defend? What is democracy and how does it work ? For the purpose of understanding the ideas described in this book it would be nice to define what Democracy is and how the authors of this text perceive it. 

There are several parts for modern democracy:
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights defines the rights of person in a democracy. For example:
Freedom of expression (speech, writings, art, science, religion, sexual orientation, etc)
Freedom of geographical movement 
Freedom of work, enterprise, and commerce.
Freedom of other activities, if they are not forbidden by a law. 
All people are equal against the law
There is separation of power between the government, parliament, and judges. 
Elections are happening in relatively frequent and recurring intervals. 
Etc


## Step aside: Why prosperity in science and economics is related to Democracy ? 

Science is a search for truth to explain how our world works: creation of theories based on real-world experiments and application of these theories on real-world problems to solve these problems. Scientific research cannot be properly done if people aren’t allowed to spread information freely and if scientists are lying. For example in USSR during 1920-1964 Lysenko suppressed scientists that didn’t agree with his falsified biological theories. Thousands of academics were silenced, sent to concentration camps, and were executed. As a consequence genetics studies in USSR were stagnated with false ideas for decades and didn’t progress till political persecution of geneticists stopped. 
Capitalism does not have to be associated with Democracy. In fact there are good examples of dictatorial countries where capitalism prosperes, such as China and Singapore. However, Capitalism does prosper in democratic countries due to freedom. When one spends time learning how technical startups become prosperous companies, one clear pattern is seen, innovation is related to freedom to economic activity. If a young company cannot iterate on business ideas and test it in practise, then such company can’t grow. 




## Stages of Democratization




## Teaching democracy

 In a way the generation raised under dictatorship would never be free. Somewhere deep inside this generation is enslaved and traumatized by the regime and societal rules in it. To establish a proper democratic society it is important to educate for Democracy in school and actually as early as in day care. Ideas of respecting the other and understanding the different are cornerstones of democracy. You would be surprised how many societies are not teaching these principles in daycares. For older ages, describing the participation in democratic processes is important. If a person is not participating in elections, demonstrations, writing letters to politicians, supporting newspapers, joining parties, then do not expect the democracy to continue much further in time.


## Non-violence 

Many promote to lead a fight against dictatorships using non-violent activities. Such activities may work against tyranny regimes which are somewhat moderate or against an occupation by a democratic country. However, it is hard to imagine how non-violence can work under extremely violent regimes such as were Stalinist USSR or the Nazi Third Reich or Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge movement in Cambodia. Even in regimes that are perceived as not too violent, peaceful resistance may not work. Good example would be the persecution of Falun Gong in China. Even though the Falun Gong movement is entirely peaceful, millions of its members are being violently persecuted in China. That includes torture and organ harvesting from live Falun Gong practitioners.

Case study: failed democratization in China via failed non violence approach.
Peaceful demonstration on the tiananmen square, the killings of Falun Gong, etc. 

Add good examples where non-violence worked.

## On importance to resist putsches 

How often putsches happen after a regime change? In a very high frequency. In Spain in 1936 and in 1978, in Russia in 1917, Germany Kapp Putsch of 1920 and Beer Hall Putsch 1923 , 1948 in Venezuela, 1991 in USSR/Russia against Gorbachev's reforms in 1991. It is worth to note that putsches happen not only against a democratic rule, but can happen against any government when this government is weak. To keep the democracy intact it is important to protect democratic bodies against assassination and violence. Body guarding the democratically-elected politicians is important. So is important the ability to work remotely and distribute the power among officials. So that if some officials are getting hit, there is a smooth power transition to be able to resist putsch attempt. Even though the power of the dictatorship governmental bodies should be dismantled, it is important to keep balance in their dismantling. Democracy is based on balance of power. Making too many people that have powerful positions angry will lead to an attempt to remove the democratic governance. The first years of Democracy are unstable due to economic instability and violence inside the population. It is hence advisable to avoid destabilizing the country even further by destroying too many governmental bodies at once. Such move probably won’t accelerate democracy.
Coups can also be initiated by foreign countries trying to block democratization. Such countries will invest money or even deploy their own soldiers to try to overthrow the new democratic government.  (Example of what US did to Iran when a democratic government was toppled ?)


## Election of Dictators


It was for the sake of this day that he had first decided to run for the Presidency, a decision which had sent waves of astonishment throughout the Imperial Galaxy --- Zaphod Beeblebrox? President? Not the Zaphod Beeblebrox? Not the President? Many had seen it as a clinching proof that the whole of known creation had finally gone bananas.
……..

Zaphod Beeblebrox, adventurer, ex-hippy, good timer, (crook? quite possibly), manic self-publicist, terribly bad at personal relationships, often thought to be completely out to lunch.

President?

No one had gone bananas, not in that way at least.

Only six people in the entire Galaxy understood the principle on which the Galaxy was governed, and they knew that once Zaphod Beeblebrox had announced his intention to run as President it was more or less a fait accompli: he was the ideal Presidency fodder.


After putsches the next danger to democracy is to elect a future dictator in a democratic election. Slowly the elected official gains power, promotes regulation to remove authority of other politicians and eventually starts to control the entire country. ….
Present Democracies are based on the idea of equal voting rights. Meaning that each individual will get the same voting strength, no matter how smart or dumb the individual is. Future dictators use this weakness of democracy by promising impossible-to-provide benefits to the not so smart population (populism). In turn, such population turns out to be the core electorate that provides support to the future dictator. Don’t be naive to think that population with higher educational standards is resistant to dumb political decisions. Having a university degree does not indicate that a person understands in psychology. Consequently, it is theoretically possible that a majority of educated population may vote for a leader with anti-social personality disorder. 

Case study: turkey. Election of Arduan and his continuous drive to undermine democracy

## Participate and infiltrate

It is worth to note that many regimes fall when insiders that gained much influence decide to reform the regime. For example both Gobachev and Yeltsin were insiders to the Communist party. Hence, their knowledge of the party, its political processes and people helped them to reform USSR and subsequently Russia. Please note that as individuals regime supporters are not always united, they may decide to follow reformists if they feel the old regime approach is dead. 
Another example would be to examine how Nikita Khrushchev reformed USSR after Stalin’s death. After Stalin’s death Khrushchev and his close circle of allied politicians quickly jailed or killed politicians that were closely allied to Stalin and his way of government. Only because Khrushchev knew how the political regime worked he was able to reform it (albeit not to a democracy, but to a way less violent regime)

## Keeping the government stable
For democracy to survive it is important to keep economic prosperity among the population. In fact, that's a key factor for the survival of any regime. During transition times from dictatorship to democracy the population needs to adjust to new rules that potentially can quickly change. Instability is not healthy for business. In addition, many times dictatorships  collapse after acquiring much debt and this debt is falling on the shoulders of a new democratic country. During dictatorship many working places and resources may be owned by the government and will go through a privatization process leading to job losses and instability. 
Investing in environment where entrepreneurship can thrive and where it is protected will help establishing the democratic rule. Otherwise, discontent people will try to bring back the old times where they at least could have a bread on their table.

## The useful idiots
The danger of the useful idiots grow as more people stay poor and uneducated about democracy. While violence and chaos may be on the rise, while employment and economy stay low, many people don't have much choice but to potentially help and support anti-democratic organizations that supply them protection and food. 
Consequently, stability of police, rule of law, food availability, and employment are important cornerstones of democratic rule.
Case study: the growth of the participants in red army in China after the famous Long march

The initial government may not be democratic for all
If we go through the history of the old democracies, they didn’t start right away from equal rights to all. Meaning equal rights to all men, women, ethnic minority groups, religious minority groups, sexual minority groups, rights for children, etc. Democracy is an evolving state of ideas that the society agrees to cherish. 
With time minorities (e.g., US slaves) gain their rights. When a new democracy is established in a society that is not ready to give full rights to all its members it is still a pretty good advance. Establishment of democratic institutions and legacy will result in future rights of society members that are not yet liberated.

Many times the initial democratic movement has to cooperate with the previous regime. Even if some high rank officials in the dictatorship regime were removed, there are hundreds of thousands of mid-level management positions occupied by supporters of the previous regime. Starting from the army, to police, to other governmental organizations. It is hard to dismantle these supporters of the previous regime from their power. Do it too quickly and the economy or security of the country will collapse. Do it too slow and the supporters will organize a coup to restore them to power. Let these supporters linger in the background and they will form a party, get democratically elected and then take the ownership of the country again while potentially transitioning back to dictatorship. 
There are no easy answers on how to deal with such supporters. Civil wars against them generally proved too bloody and destabilizing for a young country. In countries where democrats were able to negotiate deals with old regime supporters democracy could prevail. 

Case study: Chile and Pinochete’s rule (and his supporters)

## On importance of being united

Liberals and Democrats can have many political views that not necessarily agree with each other. This indeed how democracy works: people have opinions, they debate and vote on them. However, it is important to show a united front against dictatorship supporters. Dictatorship supporters will create their own parties or infiltrate democratic onse. It is important then to make sure that intense political disagreements between Democrats won't split the already shaken support of the public. Otherwise, election of suppressive party or leader is inevitable. While Democrats splitting themselves into smaller parties that have a slightly different view, the supporters of authoritarian regime get united under large parties that win the majority in the parliament and hence get an option to promote laws that limit democratic freedom. Alternatively, supporters of authoritarian regime can get much influence in the government, lock out access of democrats from broadcasting platforms, restrict control of jobs and funds by the government and so on.


## Democracy starts from jail ?
Another important difference between democracies and dictatorships are what people are jailed and prosecuted. 
In dictatorships people with anti-social personality disorders are allowed to participate in damaging activities with little consequences for them, if they play by the bureaucracy rules of the dictatorship. Meaning: dictatorship may punish a crime like beating people for fun to maintain order on the streets, but allow the same people to beat and torture political dissidents. 
In Democracy there is an invgersion: there is a set of bureaucratic rules to protect individuals. Whoever steps over them may be prosecuted and jailed. As a consequence people with anti-social personality disorders are more careful to not intimidate the low in democratic regime. They try to abuse people behind the scenes in methods that are hard to prove. Free press gives people opportunity to speak up against influential people that have anti-social personality disorders and provides an opportunity to bring them to trial. 
It is hard for a peaceful society to exist when people with anti-social personality disorder are been allowed to behave as they like. Often such people crave for power and create systems, such as working conditions, that are intolerable. In democracy such people can be punished. In dictatorship, there are no mechanisms for such punishment. 
There are many examples in the history when societies went into a state of a total anarchy. When there is no rule of a police on the street and when whoever is strong physically and is organized wins over the weak. We can start from an example on a small scale when during a 2017 Police strike in Brazil in state of Espírito Santo, crime rates spiked. With no police in the area criminals had a card blanch to steal and murder on unprecedented levels. As a result the state government had to ask the army to step in till the dispute with the police payroll could be negotiated. 
On a larger scale, Somalia was torned apart by a fifteen-years-long civil war. Consequently, Somalia became to be a so called “Failed State” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failed_state



## The constitution
Even though most of the democratic countries have constitution that does not mean that the constitution has to be written right away. In young democracy people may not be sure what they want as they never lived under a democratic regime. In addition, a young democracy can split into several countries (e.g., post-soviet split of USSR). As a consequence, it may be better to draft a set of laws that will evolve with time. After several years when the country is economically and socially stabilized it is possible to decide to move on to a constitution or continue governing without it as being done in UK, Canada, New Zealand, and Israel (all these countries have a common historical connection to the UK governing law). 
Remark: the idea of constitution was invented when life and technology didn’t change as rapidly as today. In present days the social processes change pretty quickly and hence the idea of a static set of laws that is too hard to change may not be wise anymore. 

## Meanwhile, what do the bad guys do?

To protect the democracy it is wise to spend some time thinking about the opposite side of the “fence”. The people that enjoyed the benefits of authoritarian regime, had high income while confiscating resources of the suppressed population, used to high style of life while others are in dirt, and some potentially enjoyed making others suffer. These people didn't disappear after the fall of the dictatorship. Many of them remain in power. For example, it is not easy to put different governmental employees in charge of a jail. So same people that potentially tortured political dissidents now take care of criminals and arrested supporters of the previous regime. What a convenient mix for networking. 
Jokes aside, these people are concerned about the following main issues:
Avoidance of persecution.
Keeping the status, money, etc
People with anti-social personality use the chaos to enjoy acts of violence



## What can an individual do to promote democracy?

Join some democratic party. Not necessarily on a federal level. Participate in parties on a city level as well.
Participate in demonstrations and other social activities that are linked to democracy
Educate yourself and others about democracy: what it means and how to sustain it
When you see injustice, act. Submit info to the press, distribute on social networks, complain to authorities, demonstrate.
Join country's democratic bodies: e.g., army, police, government, parliament, work for government, work for non-profits that participate in activities, join parties, work in municipalities, volunteer
Personal security and security of your family and friends is important to protect. In chaotic times of change the police may not get sufficient resources to suppress criminal activity. Being part of voluntary body that keeps peace on the streets may help
Be part of the Free press. Write articles and create videos about important issues in your region. You don't have to be part of an official news paper staff. Running a blog or a group via social network also helps
